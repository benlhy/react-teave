    "long_body": "A solid jasmine tea from Adagio. The floral notes of the jasmine are clearly woven through the tea, but it is not too overpowering. The instructions provided do tend to make a leafier sort of tea, so I recommend tasting as the tea steeps to find the point when you can just smell the jasmine. For me, I find the 1 minute 30 second mark to be perfect, depending on the temperature of the water.",

The floral jasmine notes are clear here without any sort of leafiness. I tried steeping it multiple times and the result was was the same. The texture of the tea is smooth and almost rich, which is something I have never experienced in a floral tea before. It almost hugs your lips as you sip it.",

Most Jasmine teas are delicate green things, but here, black whole leaves are used to great effect to round out the sweet smell of jasmine. The tea itself is smooth, although you would need to control the time carefully to prevent bitterness. However, it is a little expensive, so I recommend getting a sampler.",

    "long_body": "The first reaction I had to this tea was absolute astonishment. This tea is sweet! But the claim is that this tea does not contain any sugars. The sweetness is as if I added two teaspoons of sugar in it, so it is not just a hint, but definitely in the forefront and center of the taste of this tea. The cinnamon warms up the tea, and citrus tones from the dried orange peels give it a little zing. This is clever because the hint of spiciness is enhanced by the zing of the orange. Without it, in order to achieve the same level of spiciness, the cinnamon might have overwhelmed any other flavour, making it undrinkable. As it stands, this is a masterful blend that brings together several tastes into a complementary whole.",

As opposed to their other teas, their oolongs are priced comparitively with other sellers, and this is where the origin of the tea actually matters. The Ali shan oolong tea does what it says on the label: it goes out and wins a medal, and it is really, really smooth and thick, almost like honey compared to other green leaves. It is very clearly an oolong tea, there's no doubt about that. I think for its price, it is quite a good introduction to oolong teas. It doesn't require precise temperature control, and is rather forgiving if you steep it a little long.",
