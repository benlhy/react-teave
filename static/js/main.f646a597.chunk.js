The floral notes of the jasmine are clearly woven through the tea, but it is not too overpowering.

The smell of jasmine cuts through the tea, but it is not too cloying. Most Jasmine teas are delicate green things, but here, black whole leaves are used to great effect to round out the sweet smell of jasmine. The tea itself is smooth, although you would need to control the time carefully to prevent bitterness.

This tea is sweet! But the claim is that this tea does not contain any sugars. The sweetness is as if I added two teaspoons of sugar in it, so it is not just a hint, but definitely in the forefront and center of the taste of this tea. The cinnamon warms up the tea, and citrus tones from the dried orange peels give it a little zing. This is clever because the hint of spiciness is enhanced by the zing of the orange. Without it, in order to achieve the same level of spiciness, the cinnamon might have overwhelmed any other flavour, making it undrinkable. As it stands, this is a masterful blend that brings together several tastes into a complementary whole.","img_link":"hotcinspice.jpg","date":"2019","html_link":"https://www.harney.com/products/hot-cinnamon-spice-tea","manufacturer":"Harney and Sons","package_weight":"$8.00 (4 oz.)","scores":{"brewingEase":4,"flavor":4,"cost":5}},{"title":"Paris Tea, Harney and Sons","body":"A wonderful blend that does not disappoint.","long_body":"This is a rich black tea and oolong mix from Harney and Sons.

As opposed to their other teas, their oolongs are priced comparitively with other sellers, and this is where the origin of the tea actually matters. The Ali shan oolong tea does what it says on the label: it goes out and wins a medal, and it is really, really smooth and thick, almost like honey compared to other green leaves. It is very clearly an oolong tea, there\'s no doubt about that. I think for its price, it is quite a good introduction to oolong teas. It doesn\'t require precise temperature control, and is rather forgiving if you steep it a little long.","img_link":"alishan.jpg","date":"2019","html_link":"https://www.teavivre.com/superfine-taiwan-alishan-oolong-tea.html","manufacturer":"Teavivre","package_weight":"$23.90 (3.5 oz)","scores":{"brewingEase":4,"flavor":4,"cost":5}},{"title":"Green Tea with Jasmine, Taylors of Harrogate","body":"A convenient, cheap, and good option for jasmine tea.
