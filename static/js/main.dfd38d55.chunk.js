This tea is sweet! But the claim is that this tea does not contain any sugars. The sweetness is as if I added two teaspoons of sugar in it, so it is not just a hint, but definitely in the forefront and center of the taste of this tea. The cinnamon warms up the tea, and citrus tones from the dried orange peels give it a little zing. This is clever because the hint of spiciness is enhanced by the zing of the orange. Without it, in order to achieve the same level of spiciness, the cinnamon might have overwhelmed any other flavour, making it undrinkable. As it stands, this is a masterful blend that brings together several tastes into a complementary whole.","img_link":"hotcinspice.jpg","date":"2019","html_link":"https://www.harney.com/products/hot-cinnamon-spice-tea","manufacturer":"Harney and Sons","package_weight":"$8.00 (4 oz.)","scores":{"brewingEase":4,"flavor":4,"cost":5}},{"title":"Paris Tea, Harney and Sons","body":"A wonderful blend that does not disappoint.","long_body":"This is a rich black tea and oolong mix from Harney and Sons.

The Ali shan oolong tea does what it says on the label: it goes out and wins a medal, and it is really, really smooth and thick, almost like honey compared to other green leaves. It is very clearly an oolong tea, there\'s no doubt about that. I think for its price, it is quite a good introduction to oolong teas.
