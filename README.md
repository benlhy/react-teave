# React-Teave

This is a app meant to rank the teas that I drink, with user weighted categories to provide a more useful ranking than my own subjective experience.

This app was built using a modified create-react-app base.

This was built to explore and learn React.

## Getting started (once forked)

You will need: [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

1. Install dependencies

`yarn`

2. Run the app

`yarn start`

## What's included

**Libraries**

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) - a comprehensive React UI library

**Dev tools**

- Automatic code formatting on commit, using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is set up to format on save.
- SASS - Write and import your css as `.scss` files, they will be auto-compiled
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) - a utility-first CSS framework for easy & consistent styling

**Configuration**

- Allow absolute imports from `src` (set in `jsconfig.json`)
  - Write imports as `import Button from "components/Button"` instead of ugly stuff like `import Button from "./../../components/Button"` (this still works too)

## Learn More

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
